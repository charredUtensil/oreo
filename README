As of now, Oreo is only supported on Linux, but with the exception of a few commands (namely /update and /backup,) it should work alright on Windows, but no promises.

Install Ruby, if it's not installed. I strongly reccommend the latest 1.9 but it might still be compatible with 1.8
2) Stop your Minecraft server, if it's running
3) cd to the directory your Minecraft server is installed in
4) Install Oreo in a subdirectory of that (Installer coming soon?)
5) To start the server, execute the run_server script. If you're remoted into this box, I reccommend starting it in a screen session. For added security, I'd reccommend running RAdmin as a user that isn't you, especially if you have superuser privelages and especially if you run in --development mode. Here's the shell script I use to run my server:

Code: Select all
    #!/bin/bash
    screen -dr minecraft || screen -S minecraft sudo -u minecraft /etc/minecraft/oreo/run_server --color --development $*


6) You'll need to join your server. It'll be exactly where it was when you ran vanilla. Oreo, again, isn't a mod. It shouldn't need to be updated when Minecraft does, and it shouldn't change anything about itself.
7) In the console, type the following command:

    /allow YOURUSERNAMEHERE *

This will grant you access to every command Oreo has to offer. If you have op privelages, you will need to /deop yourself or Oreo won't parse your commands.
8) Type /help for a list of commands or /help COMMAND for help using that command.

Files: Oreo stores its code files in the directory you extract the tar. This is meant to be a subdirectory of the Minecraft root folder, but that's not entirely necessary. It also makes a file, oreo.log, in the minecraft root folder, and a file for each user's preferences of the form username.cfg in the same folder Minecraft saves its player data.
